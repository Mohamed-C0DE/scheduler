# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a react application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. Users are able to pick a day in the week and see all their appointment, and if they decide they want to change any elements about a booked appointment, like the interviewer, they can select 1 of the other 4 interviewers available.
